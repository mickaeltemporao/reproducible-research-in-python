# Reproducible Research in Python

This notebook was created as part of a workshop on *Reproducible Research in Python*. 
- You can access the workshop materials here: [Reproducible Research in Python](https://github.com/mickaeltemporao/reproducible-research-in-python).

## Important Note

This is a hands on workshop. It is better if you start coding along with me during the workshop, experiment bugs and try to understand your errors. 
Learn by doing and try to avoid copy/pasting.

Feel free to ask questions at any time during the workshop.

## Prerequisites
The workshop assumes no prior knowledge of the Python programming language. Familiarity with R, vectors, data frames, and basic statistical analyses, such as linear regression is helpful but not required.

- Students are expected to have a computer or a laptop to follow along the coding section of each session.

This workshop is meant to provide a brief introduction to 
[Python](https://www.python.org/) with a focus towards Data Science. The workshop is divided into three parts: The first part provides an introduction the Python programming language. The second part of the workshop will guide you through data acquisition, cleaning and exploration. In the third and last part, you will learn how to train, save, load, and make predictions your own machine learningmodels.
