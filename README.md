# Reproducible Research in Python
_Workshop at McMaster University, October 25th 2019_

This notebook was created as part of a workshop on *Reproducible Research in Python*. 
- You can access the workshop materials here: [Reproducible Research in Python](https://github.com/mickaeltemporao/reproducible-research-in-python).

## Important Note

This is a hands on workshop. It is better if you start coding along with me during the workshop, experiment bugs and try to understand your errors. 
Learn by doing and try to avoid copy/pasting.

Feel free to ask questions at any time during the workshop.

## Prerequisites
Prior to the workshop, users need to:
- [ ] Account on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) 
- [ ] Account on [GitHub](https://github.com/)

## Structure
This workshop is divided into three parts. The first part is an introduction the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language where you will learn the basics of the language and how to use built-in libraries. The second part of the workshop will teach you how to acquire, explore, and transform data. In the third and last part, you will learn how to train, save, and load models from data.
